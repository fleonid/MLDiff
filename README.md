## ðŸ“„ Description

This code implements a **maximum-likelihood-based numerical differentiation method** using **optimal smoothing quadratic and zero-order splines**. It is designed to estimate the derivative of a signal measured under **coarse, non-uniform sampling** and corrupted by **Gaussian noise**.

The implementation reproduces the key results and figures described in the above article, including comparisons with classical differentiators and performance under various noise and sampling conditions.
